# Connect-Four-Project-1
General Assembly Project 1: Pseudo code
1.) Define required constants

2.) Define required variables for the game

3.) Store cached elements on the JS to be accessed whenever needed inside the code

4) Loading the app should:
    4.1) Initialize the state variables
    4.2) Render all values
    4.3) Wait for user(s) to click on a circle

5) When a player clicks a circle, change the color to match the player
    5.1) As the circle is clicked, text should appear to display the turn of the current player.
6) If one player gets 4 connected circles (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) let that player be the winner of the game. If no circles end up connected then let the message display as a tie.

7) Once the player(s) finish the game let the replay button appear to re-initialize the game.
